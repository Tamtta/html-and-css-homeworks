        <h2>WHAT HAPPENED</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            We suffered another disappointing Premier League defeat on Saturday
            as we were beaten 1-0 by Southampton.
          </p>
          <p>
            We had chances to take control of the game early on at St Maryâ€™s -
            but with a brief lapse in concentration, we allowed the hosts to
            take the lead on the stroke of half-time and failed to find a way
            past Fraser Forster.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right from kick-off, Mikel Arteta decided to start Bukayo Saka on
            the left and Gabriel Martinelli on the right, a direct swap from
            their usual positions, and this caused the Saints all sorts of
            trouble in the opening exchanges.
          </p>
          <p>
            First up, Saka saw his powerful effort blocked on the edge of the
            area from a well-worked corner routine, before Martinelli cut inside
            from the wing and worked Forster into a difficult save down to his
            right-hand side.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was a moment of worry when Armando Broja wriggled free inside
            the area and rolled the ball across the face of goal, but the best
            chance of the opening quarter fell to Saka, who looked certain to
            score from a sweeping counter-attack. Martinelli was played through
            down the right and squared for our No 7 on the opposite side, only
            for Forster to produce an outstanding save on the goalline.
          </p>
          <p>
            We had the chance to put in some dangerous deliveries before the
            break after winning free-kicks in two promising positions, but we
            failed to make them count and we were punished by the hosts on the
            stroke of half-time.
          </p>
          <p>
            After clearing our lines from a trademark corner delivery from James
            Ward-Prowse, the ball was picked back up by Mohamed Elyounoussi and
            crossed for Jan Bednarek, who fired past Aaron Ramsdale at the near
            post.
          </p>
          <p>
            We came out fighting in the second half and Nuno Tavares tried his
            luck twice in quick succession, before Eddie Nketiahâ€™s instinctive
            backheel effort rolled just wide of the far post.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still searching for an equaliser, Arteta opted for a change of
            system on the hour mark with Emile Smith Rowe replacing Cedric
            Soares, and Ben White shifting out wide to cover the right flank.
          </p>
          <p>
            The travelling Arsenal fans thought weâ€™d equalised when Saka cut
            inside from the right and fired towards goal, but his curling effort
            sailed just wide of the top corner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps our best chance of the second half arrived shortly after,
            though, with Forster producing another outstanding save to deny
            Smith Rowe an equaliser from inside the area.
          </p>
          <p>
            Saka came close once more with a low driven effort and so too did
            our captain Odegaard, followed by a stunning Xhaka strike from
            distance, but we were unable to find a way past Forster and secure a
            share of the spoils late on.
